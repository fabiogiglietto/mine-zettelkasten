# Industry influence in high-profile social media research

## Summary

This metascience paper quantifies the extent of industry influence in high-profile social media research published in *Science*, *Nature*, *PNAS*, and their transfer journals. Drawing on public data covering funding, collaboration, and employment ties to Meta, X, Google, and Microsoft, Bak-Coleman and colleagues show that roughly half of such papers have disclosable ties to platform companies, yet the great majority of these ties are never declared. They argue that influence operates not only through authorship but also through editorial handling and peer review, producing an "industrially saturated" literature in which only about one in five papers is plausibly independent. The authors frame this pattern as analogous to documented industry influence in tobacco, pharmaceutical, and nutrition science, and warn that it skews both topical attention and the evaluative apparatus of the field.

## Key Contributions

- First systematic, quantitative mapping of industry ties across authors, editors, *and* reviewers in elite social media research.
- Introduces the composite concept of **industrial saturation** to capture cumulative influence across the publication pipeline.
- Documents a large empirical gap between formal competing-interest disclosures and publicly identifiable ties.
- Provides evidence of topical bias (over-representation of user-focused misinformation work; under-representation of platform dynamics) consistent with industrial selection effects.
- Proposes concrete reforms: stronger disclosure norms, retrospective corrections, and explicit independence statements by unaffiliated authors.

## Methods

The authors built a corpus of 295 articles by 1210 authors via OpenAlex queries plus bibliographic coupling, then identified disclosable ties to Meta, X, Google, and Microsoft using OpenAlex, industry-announced RFPs/fellowships, and manual validation of all funding and employment links, applying each journal's 3–5 year disclosure window. They cross-referenced 80 academic editors (167 manuscripts) and 82 named reviewers against public CVs, used Altmetric for impact, applied community detection on the bibliographic coupling network for topical clustering, and modelled disclosure and tie-probability via Bayesian binomial and logistic regressions. CV-based audits provided a sensitivity estimate suggesting public-data approaches substantially under-detect ties.

## Findings

- 49% of papers had disclosable industry ties; only 13% included a competing-interest declaration and 20% mentioned ties at all.
- 42% of papers explicitly declaring no competing interests nonetheless had disclosable ties.
- Industry support is highly concentrated (Gini = 0.919); the top 10% of authors received 79% of investment, and prolific authors (6+ high-profile papers) nearly always had ties.
- 34% of editors had disclosable ties — roughly double the author rate — and none were disclosed; 11% of papers handled by tied editors were authored by their recent co-authors.
- Only 14% of editor funding-years detectable from CVs were visible in public data, implying substantial undercounting.
- Estimated industrial saturation reaches ~80% once authors, editors, and reviewers are aggregated.
- Misinformation-sharing research is over-represented among industry-tied work; platform-dynamics research is under-represented.
- Industry-tied papers receive roughly twice the citations, policy mentions, news coverage, social media discussion, and Wikipedia references of independent papers.

## Connections

This paper extends the same authors' broader critique of platform-dependent research infrastructure articulated in [[Bak-Coleman2025-pm]], and resonates with concerns about access asymmetries and the politics of data provision raised by [[Freelon2024-sc]], [[Rieder2025-ju]], and [[Rieder2026-pp]]. It also speaks to debates about methodological dependence on platform-mediated data running through work like [[Ohme2026-nv]], [[Tornberg2026-lc]], and [[Murtfeldt2025-wu]], situating the metascience of industry influence as a structural condition shaping the empirical agenda of computational social science.
