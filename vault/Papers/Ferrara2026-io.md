## Summary

ECHO is a self-supervised graph learning framework for attributed community detection that targets two complementary failure modes of GNN-based approaches: a *Semantic Wall* (over-smoothing and heterophilic poisoning from rigid inductive biases) and a *Systems Wall* (the O(N²) memory cost of dense pairwise similarity clustering). The system routes each graph to an Isolating (MLP) or Densifying (GraphSAGE) encoder via unsupervised structural heuristics, applies attention-guided K-step diffusion to throttle information flow across heterophilic edges, trains with a memory-sharded full-batch InfoNCE objective, and extracts communities through chunked O(N·K) top-k similarity feeding into modularity maximization. On LFR benchmarks up to 1M nodes and real attributed graphs including Pokec (1.6M nodes, 30M edges), ECHO reaches state-of-the-art NMI on several datasets while sustaining >2,800 nodes/sec on a single A100.

## Key Contributions

- **Topology-Aware Router** that picks between MLP and GraphSAGE encoders using feature sparsity ρ_X, mean degree ⟨k⟩, and semantic assortativity H_R, avoiding a one-size-fits-all inductive bias.
- **Attention-guided multi-scale diffusion** with learned edge weights and an L1 sparsity penalty, dynamically pruning heterophilic edges to mitigate over-smoothing.
- **Memory-sharded full-batch InfoNCE**: exact full-batch gradients with VRAM bounded by dynamic chunking of the negative-sample tensor.
- **Chunked O(N·K) similarity extraction** with degree-adaptive top-k and mutual-max symmetrization, replacing the dense O(N²) similarity matrix.
- An **open-source unified framework (ECHO-GNN)** demonstrated end-to-end on graphs >1.6M nodes / >30M edges on commodity hardware.

## Methods

Four-phase pipeline: (1) unsupervised routing on ρ_X, ⟨k⟩, H_R to select Isolating MLP vs. Densifying SAGE; (2) adaptive semantic encoding; (3) K-step diffusion with softmax edge attention from an MLP over concatenated node pairs; (4) chunked cosine top-k extraction with degree-adaptive k_i ∈ [k_min, k_max], followed by Louvain/Leiden modularity maximization via igraph. Training uses an InfoNCE loss with attention-weighted positives and 256 negatives per node, sharding triggered when N×P×d exceeds 2×10⁸ elements. Evaluation spans LFR (N=500–5,000 and scaled to 1M, μ=0.5) and real graphs (Chameleon, Actor, Amazon Photo/Computers, Coauthor CS, CoraFull, YouTube, Pokec), against K-Means, LPA, Leiden, LINE, DGI, MVGRL, and SDCN. Implementation is PyTorch 2.6 with TF32/AMP on a single A100 80GB.

## Findings

- At the LFR boundary μ=0.5 with N=5,000, ECHO reaches NMI 0.3663, well above DGI (0.1607), MVGRL (0.1677), LINE (0.3463), LPA (0.1912), and SDCN (0.1737), and is stable or improving with scale while SDCN degrades.
- State-of-the-art NMI on Chameleon (0.1701), Amazon Photo (0.7290), Amazon Computers (0.5957), CoraFull (0.5114), and a near-tie with DGI on Coauthor CS (0.7042 vs 0.7071).
- MVGRL OOMs beyond ~5,000 nodes and SDCN is numerically unstable, underscoring the systems advantage of the sharded design.
- Throughput: ≈3,266 nodes/s on synthetic YouTube (347s) and ≈2,805 nodes/s on Pokec (582s) on a single A100.
- The router systematically picks the Isolating MLP for dense/heterophilic graphs (Chameleon, Actor, Amazon Photo/Computers) and the Densifying SAGE for sparse, feature-rich, or large graphs (Coauthor CS, CoraFull, YouTube, Pokec); K=0 dominates mid-scale, K=1 for the largest social graphs.
- t-SNE on Cora and Amazon Computers shows visibly more separable clusters in ECHO embeddings than in raw features.

## Connections

No other papers have been registered under this note's topics yet, so there are no sibling notes to link. Conceptually, ECHO sits between classical modularity-based community detection (Louvain/Leiden, generalized k-path methods) and self-supervised attributed graph learning (DGI, MVGRL, GraphCL, SDCN), and would naturally connect to future notes on over-smoothing in GNNs, contrastive learning at scale, and heterophily-aware message passing.
