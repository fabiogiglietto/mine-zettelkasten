# Full-text access via Google Drive

The notes and `data/summaries/<id>.json` are the user's *prior reading* —
deliberately condensed. The **full text** of most papers lives as a PDF in the
user's Paperpile **Google Drive** folder (the same folder the `toread` pipeline
extracts from). This file is how the skill reaches the primary source when a
draft needs more than the summary carries.

Access is through the **claude.ai Google Drive MCP connector**
(`mcp__claude_ai_Google_Drive__*`), which reads the user's own Drive. There is
**no** local script, credential, or pip install for this path.

## When to use it

**Only when the user explicitly asks**, for a *named, load-bearing* paper —
e.g. "pull the full text of Thiele2025-ol," "check what the paper actually
reports," "I need an exact quote/figure/method detail from X." It is never a
default step: note summaries remain the substrate for every draft. Don't fetch
full text proactively, in bulk, or "to be safe."

## The Paperpile folder

- **Folder id:** not stored here — it's a private resource. Obtain it from the
  `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` environment variable, or the project's `.env` (the same
  source the `toread` pipeline uses; `.env` is gitignored, so the id never lands in
  this published skill). If neither is set — e.g. a collaborator without the
  pipeline's `.env`, or a fresh clone in `/tmp` — treat full text as unavailable and
  fall back to the note summaries.
- **Filename format:** `[FirstAuthor] [Year] - [Title].pdf`, or for multiple
  authors `[FirstAuthor] et al. [Year] - [Title].pdf`.
  Examples: `Matias 2025 - How public involvement can improve the science of AI.pdf`,
  `Pierri et al. 2025 - Research opportunities and challenges.pdf`.
- **Prerequisite:** the folder must be shared with the Google account the
  claude.ai Drive connector is signed in to. If a folder-scoped search returns
  *nothing* (or `get_file_metadata` on the folder id says "not found"), that's an
  **access** problem — the folder isn't shared with the connected account, or the id
  isn't set — not a sign the paper is missing. Say so rather than concluding the PDF
  doesn't exist.

## Find the PDF

You already have the note's `title`, `authors`, and `year` (in `index.json` and
the note frontmatter). Build a `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Drive__search_files` query
scoped to the folder, keyed on the first author's **surname** plus one or two
**distinctive title words** — not the whole title, since filenames truncate and
vary:

```
parentId = '<GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID>'    # from env / .env — see "The Paperpile folder"
  and mimeType = 'application/pdf'
  and title contains '<first-author surname>'
  and title contains '<distinctive title word>'
```

If the title search misses (unusual punctuation, abbreviated title), retry with
a different title word, or fall back to `fullText contains '<distinctive phrase>'`
within the same folder.

## Disambiguate (don't read the wrong PDF)

This mirrors `src/drive_client.py::find_pdf`, applied by judgment rather than a
score:

1. Prefer the candidate whose **filename title clearly matches** the note title.
2. Confirm the **author surname** and the **year** appear in the filename.
3. An author with several papers in the folder (e.g. `Giglietto`,
   `Bak-Coleman`) will return multiple hits — the year plus a title word should
   isolate the right one.
4. If several candidates survive, or none clearly matches, **report the
   ambiguity and ask** — never guess a PDF. Reading the wrong paper is worse than
   falling back to the summary.

## Read it

Once you have the file id, use
`mcp__claude_ai_Google_Drive__read_file_content(fileId)` — it supports
`application/pdf` and returns a natural-language text representation, so no
download/parse step is needed. For very large PDFs the returned text may be
**truncated** (per the tool's own caveat); if a needed section is missing, say so
rather than assuming the paper omits it.

## Integrity (extends SKILL.md Step 4)

- Full text is a **primary source** — you may quote it and cite exact figures.
  Quote precisely and sparingly; attribute to the paper, not the note.
- Still build the **reference** from the note's frontmatter
  (`authors`/`year`/`doi`) — the Drive filename is not a citation.
- In the **provenance map**, mark which claims were *verified against full text*
  versus those resting on the summary. This is the whole point: it tells the user
  exactly which sentences have been checked against the source.
- If the connector is unavailable (e.g. a headless/cron run) or no PDF matches,
  **say so and fall back to the summary** — degrade, never fabricate.
